Compressing the text file.


The Compress.exe is only designed to compress the files containing the characters which have byte representation 0-255 (decimal).
Input file to be compressed should be names "input.txt" without quotes.
It produces a intermediate text file output.txt which shows a binary representation of the compressed text file.
Now using BitToChar.exe we can convert this binary file to actual compressed file.
